# DryActive

a name that i made up on the spot because why not.

this is basically a dry, yet daily-drivable shell based on the amazing ags & astal combo. The only real customisation offered here is the choice of primary colour, and that's for a good reason: there are always more important tasks to finish and endless ricing would not be of help, for me at least. Every day we are being motivationally anchored to stimuli we don't even consider important. Yet, they affect us in tremendous ways. Your system's UI, being one of them. I wanted to reduce that effect, especially as I suffer from having a very tiny motivational memory.

it offers an incomprehensive subset of what you'd expect from a barebones shell:

- clock
- mpris (media player) integration (hover on clock to show, click to pause/play)
- notificatoins
- lock screen (`ags request lock`)
- workspaces
- tray (dbus actions are disabled because of a memory leak. search and uncomment `menuModel` to activate)
- OSD + scroll triggers for brightness (scroll on the battery icon) and volume (the speaker/mic icon)
- power menu
